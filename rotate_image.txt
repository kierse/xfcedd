Ideas for new rotate_image:
---------------------------

- have running daemon grab socket when it starts.  This will allow 
for 2 things:
  a) whenever rotate_image starts it can check if there is another
     instance running.  If so, it can notify the caller and exit
  b) can call running process and pass instructions through socket
     ie. exit, change sleep time, pick random image, display specific
	      image, etc.

- have daemon keep log of previous X images so it can ensure there are
no repeats.
